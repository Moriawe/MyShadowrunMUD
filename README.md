# MyShadowrunMUD
Schoolassignment - Labb3
I made his "MUD" for a schoolassignment in september 2021 after learning java for about a month.

You get to chose your players name and profession
Decker, Spellcaster or Street Samurai
and are given certain stats in 
speed, strength and wisdom
depending on your choice of profession

You begin at level 1 and if you get all the way to level 10 you win the game.

During your adventures you can encounter some enemies (with different spawningration)
Dogs, Thugs, Archmages and EpicMonsters
They all have their own stats and weapons

You will get 4 options. 
Attack1, Attack2, Drink a potion and Flee!
Every entity has 2 different attacks. If you chose to attack2, your enemy will to.
If you chose to drink a potion the game will go through your potionbag to see if you have any and let you chose which one to drink.

If you kill your opponent you gain xp and loot their gold
If you get killed you die and loose the game.

There is a store you can use to buy potions for your gold.
Healing, Speed, Strength and Wisdom.




TODO list
Better balancing on entity stats :) <BR>
Balancing up goldloot. <BR>
Let the enemies level up as you do so you can meet harder resistans / OR / meet different enemes depending on level.
Have a random value that will make the enemy use either attack1 or attack2.
Let the store have it's own stock and treasury so it can run out of items.
It will also let you sell items that you loot at the store and give you money from the treasury.
