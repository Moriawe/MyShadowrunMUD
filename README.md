# MyShadowrunMUD<BR>
Schoolassignment - Labb3<BR>
I made his "MUD" for a schoolassignment in september 2021 after learning java for about a month.<BR>
<BR><BR>
You get to chose your players name and profession<BR>
Decker, Spellcaster or Street Samurai<BR>
and are given certain stats in <BR>
speed, strength and wisdom<BR>
depending on your choice of profession<BR>
<BR><BR>
You begin at level 1 and if you get all the way to level 10 you win the game.<BR>
<BR><BR>
During your adventures you can encounter some enemies (with different spawningration)<BR>
Dogs, Thugs, Archmages and EpicMonsters<BR>
They all have their own stats and weapons<BR>
<BR><BR>
You will get 4 options. <BR>
Attack1, Attack2, Drink a potion and Flee!<BR>
Every entity has 2 different attacks. If you chose to attack2, your enemy will to.<BR>
If you chose to drink a potion the game will go through your potionbag to see if you have any and let you chose which one to drink.<BR>
<BR>
If you kill your opponent you gain xp and loot their gold<BR>
If you get killed you die and loose the game.<BR>
<BR>
There is a store you can use to buy potions for your gold.<BR>
Healing, Speed, Strength and Wisdom.<BR>

TODO list<BR>
Better balancing on entity stats :) <BR>
Balancing up goldloot. <BR>
Let the enemies level up as you do so you can meet harder resistans / OR / meet different enemes depending on level.<BR>
Have a random value that will make the enemy use either attack1 or attack2.<BR>
Let the store have it's own stock and treasury so it can run out of items.<BR>
It will also let you sell items that you loot at the store and give you money from the treasury.<BR>
